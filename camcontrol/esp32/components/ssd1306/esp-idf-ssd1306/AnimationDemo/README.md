I borrowed the BIT MAP data from [here](https://www.mischianti.org/2021/07/14/ssd1306-oled-display-draw-images-splash-and-animations-2/).   

__Wire cables should be as short as possible.__   

__Flip upside down cannot be enabled.__   

I used a 10 cm wire cable.   
However, it is sometimes affected by noise.
